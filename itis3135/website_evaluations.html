          Two sigma investments is a company based in New York, which uses AI, machine learning, and many other methods for its trading strategies. This website is designed with many eye catching componenets to showcase their company. This website has a lot of important information such as how to pass their technical interview, the amount of trades the company has done, and even stuff they've created like "gyms for the mind".

        <ul>
        <li>Contrast - On of the main ways this website uses Contrast is how the Title is displayed when you first enter the website. They added a transparent picture for the font, with a white background. This makes the title stick out. Another way this website has used contrast is by putting important information in big boxes.</li>
        <li>Repetition - This website repeats white text over black or blue text throughout the whole website. This gives a sense of unity. </li>
        <li>Alignment - Throughout this website they've used literal lines which replicate somehwat a grid system. This showcases that a lot of their text and other componenets have been aligned properly. </li>
        <li>Proximity  - This website groups many similar things in 1 category. An example is at the bottom of the website they showcase a lot of their accomplishments in a single setcion.</li>
